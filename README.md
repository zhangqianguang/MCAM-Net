## Multi-scale Convolutional Attention for Enhanced Industrial Surface Defect Detection. 
This repository contains the code for MCAM-Net.

## Introduction
This is the official implementation of our paper titled "ETDNet: Efficient Transformer-Based Detection Network for Surface Defect Detection".
This paper is currently being submitted to the visual computer journal
For more details, please refer to our paper. This repo is based on PyTorch.

## Datasets
We release NEU-DET dataset and GC10-DET used in this paper, including VOC style.
Download the dataset(s) from corresponding links below.
